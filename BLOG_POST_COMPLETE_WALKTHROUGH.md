Building a Modern Data Lakehouse: ClickHouse + MySQL + OLake + Iceberg Integration

One of the Cheapest Ways to Get Your Complete Apache Iceberg Ecosystem Covered End-to-End

What You'll Build

Last night, I went on to experiment with ClickHouse's experimental Iceberg write support and managed to get it working end-to-end! What we're building here is essentially one of the most cost-effective ways to get a complete Apache Iceberg ecosystem running.

By the end of this tutorial, you'll have a complete, production-ready data lakehouse architecture featuring:

- MySQL 8.0 as operational database with CDC-enabled binlog
- ClickHouse with experimental Iceberg write support  
- OLake for real-time Change Data Capture (CDC)
- Apache Iceberg tables for data lake storage
- MinIO as S3-compatible object storage
- Cross-database analytics capabilities

The beauty of this setup is that it gives you enterprise-grade data lakehouse capabilities for basically the cost of your laptop!

Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- 8GB+ RAM available
- Basic understanding of SQL and data engineering concepts
- Terminal/command line access

Architecture Overview

So, what exactly are we building here? Well, imagine having a system where your operational data flows seamlessly into your analytical data lake, all in real-time. That's exactly what this architecture delivers:

┌─────────────┐    CDC     ┌─────────────┐    Writes    ┌─────────────┐
│    MySQL    │ ────────→ │    OLake    │ ────────────→ │   Iceberg   │
│  (Source)   │           │ (Pipeline)  │              │ (Data Lake) │
└─────────────┘           └─────────────┘              └─────────────┘
       │                                                       ▲
       │                Real-time Queries                      │
       │                                                       │
       └────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
                              ClickHouse
                         (Query Engine + Bridge)

The flow works like this: MySQL captures your operational data, OLake handles the real-time CDC pipeline, ClickHouse serves as both the query engine and the bridge to Iceberg, and finally, your data lands in Apache Iceberg format for long-term storage and analytics. Pretty neat, right?

Step 1: Project Setup

Alright, let's get started! First, we need to set up our project structure. This is where we'll organize all our configuration files, scripts, and documentation.

1.1 Create Project Directory

Let's start by creating our project directory and navigating into it:

mkdir clickhouse-lakehouse
cd clickhouse-lakehouse

Screenshot Needed: Terminal showing directory creation

1.2 Create Directory Structure

Now, let's create the directory structure that will hold all our configuration files. This organization will make it much easier to manage our setup:

```bash
mkdir -p {mysql-init,clickhouse-config,olake-config,scripts,docs}
```

Your project structure should look like this:
```
clickhouse-lakehouse/
├── docker-compose.yml          # Our main orchestration file
├── mysql-init/                 # MySQL initialization scripts
├── clickhouse-config/          # ClickHouse configuration files
├── olake-config/              # OLake pipeline configurations
├── scripts/                   # Utility and demo scripts
└── docs/                      # Documentation and guides
```

This structure keeps everything organized and makes it easy to find what you need. Each directory has a specific purpose, which we'll explore as we build out each component.

## 🗄️ Step 2: MySQL Configuration with CDC

Now we get to the fun part - setting up our infrastructure! We'll start with the Docker Compose file, which is essentially the blueprint for our entire data lakehouse. This single file will orchestrate all our services and make sure they can communicate with each other.

### 2.1 Create Docker Compose File

Let's create our `docker-compose.yml` file. This is where the magic happens - it defines all our services, their configurations, networking, and dependencies:

```yaml
# Docker Compose file for ClickHouse + MySQL + OLake + Iceberg Demo

services:
  # MySQL 8.0 with CDC enabled

### 2.2 Create MySQL Initialization Scripts

Now we need to set up our MySQL database with some realistic data. We'll create initialization scripts that will automatically run when the MySQL container starts up. This ensures we have consistent data every time we start our environment.

Let's create `mysql-init/01-setup.sql` - this file will set up our demo database with realistic e-commerce data:

```sql
-- Demo database setup with realistic e-commerce data
USE demo_db;

-- Create users table
CREATE TABLE users (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    full_name VARCHAR(100),
    age INT,
    country VARCHAR(50),
    status ENUM('active', 'inactive', 'premium') DEFAULT 'active',
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Create products table
CREATE TABLE products (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    product_name VARCHAR(200) NOT NULL,
    category VARCHAR(100),
    price DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
    stock_quantity INT DEFAULT 0,
    is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Create orders table  
CREATE TABLE orders (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INT NOT NULL,
    product_id INT NOT NULL,
    quantity INT NOT NULL,
    unit_price DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
    total_amount DECIMAL(10,2),
    status ENUM('pending', 'confirmed', 'shipped', 'delivered', 'cancelled') DEFAULT 'pending',
    order_date TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    shipping_address TEXT,
    notes TEXT,
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id),
    FOREIGN KEY (product_id) REFERENCES products(id)
);

-- Create user sessions table
CREATE TABLE user_sessions (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INT NOT NULL,
    session_token VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    login_time TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    last_activity TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    ip_address VARCHAR(45),
    user_agent TEXT,
    is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE,
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id)
);

-- Insert sample users
INSERT INTO users (username, email, full_name, age, country, status) VALUES
('john_doe', 'john.doe@example.com', 'John Doe', 28, 'USA', 'premium'),

('henry_taylor', 'henry.taylor@example.com', 'Henry Taylor', 33, 'Netherlands', 'active'),
('ivy_anderson', 'ivy.anderson@example.com', 'Ivy Anderson', 30, 'Sweden', 'premium');

-- Insert sample products
INSERT INTO products (product_name, category, price, stock_quantity) VALUES

('Monitor Stand', 'Accessories', 99.99, 90),
('Webcam HD', 'Electronics', 89.99, 110),
('Bluetooth Speaker', 'Electronics', 149.99, 85),
('Gaming Chair', 'Furniture', 299.99, 45),
('Desk Lamp', 'Furniture', 69.99, 130),
('Coffee Mug', 'Accessories', 19.99, 500);

-- Insert sample orders
INSERT INTO orders (user_id, product_id, quantity, unit_price, total_amount, status) VALUES
(1, 1, 1, 2499.99, 2499.99, 'delivered'),
(1, 6, 2, 249.99, 499.98, 'delivered'),
(2, 2, 1, 999.99, 999.99, 'shipped'),

(3, 3, 1, 899.99, 899.99, 'confirmed'),
(4, 4, 1, 1299.99, 1299.99, 'pending'),
(5, 5, 1, 599.99, 599.99, 'cancelled'),
(6, 7, 1, 399.99, 399.99, 'delivered'),
(7, 9, 3, 59.99, 179.97, 'confirmed'),
(8, 10, 2, 79.99, 159.98, 'shipped'),
(9, 11, 1, 99.99, 99.99, 'delivered'),
(10, 12, 1, 89.99, 89.99, 'pending'),
(1, 13, 1, 149.99, 149.99, 'delivered'),
(3, 14, 1, 299.99, 299.99, 'confirmed'),
(5, 16, 5, 19.99, 99.95, 'delivered');

-- Insert sample user sessions
INSERT INTO user_sessions (user_id, session_token, ip_address, user_agent) VALUES
(1, CONCAT('sess_john_', UNIX_TIMESTAMP()), '192.168.1.100', 'Mozilla/5.0 (Mac) Chrome/120.0'),
(2, CONCAT('sess_jane_', UNIX_TIMESTAMP()), '192.168.1.101', 'Mozilla/5.0 (Windows) Chrome/120.0'),
(3, CONCAT('sess_bob_', UNIX_TIMESTAMP()), '192.168.1.102', 'Mozilla/5.0 (Linux) Firefox/120.0'),
(4, CONCAT('sess_alice_', UNIX_TIMESTAMP()), '192.168.1.103', 'Mozilla/5.0 (Mac) Safari/17.0'),
(6, CONCAT('sess_diana_', UNIX_TIMESTAMP()), '192.168.1.105', 'Mozilla/5.0 (Windows) Edge/120.0'),

(10, CONCAT('sess_ivy_', UNIX_TIMESTAMP()), '192.168.1.109', 'Mozilla/5.0 (Mac) Safari/17.0');
```

Next, let's create `mysql-init/02-permissions.sql` - this file sets up the proper user permissions for our CDC pipeline and ensures OLake can access the data it needs:

```sql
-- Create OLake CDC user with proper permissions
CREATE USER IF NOT EXISTS 'olake'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'olake_pass';

-- Grant necessary permissions for CDC
GRANT SELECT, RELOAD, SHOW DATABASES, REPLICATION SLAVE, REPLICATION CLIENT ON *.* TO 'olake'@'%';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON demo_db.* TO 'olake'@'%';

-- Grant permissions for demo user
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON demo_db.* TO 'demo_user'@'%';

FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

-- Show final user permissions
SHOW GRANTS FOR 'olake'@'%';
SHOW GRANTS FOR 'demo_user'@'%';
```

**📸 Screenshot Needed**: MySQL initialization scripts created

## ⚡ Step 3: ClickHouse Configuration with Iceberg Support

Now we move to the heart of our system - ClickHouse! This is where things get really exciting because we're enabling experimental Iceberg write support. This feature is what makes our setup so powerful and cutting-edge.

### 3.1 Create ClickHouse Configuration

Let's create `clickhouse-config/config.xml` - this file enables the experimental Iceberg features and configures ClickHouse to work with our MinIO S3 storage:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<clickhouse>
    <listen_host>::</listen_host>
    <http_port>8123</http_port>
    <tcp_port>9000</tcp_port>
    <mysql_port>9004</mysql_port>
    
    <logger>
        <level>trace</level>
        <console>1</console>
    </logger>
    
    <profiles>
        <default>
            <allow_experimental_insert_into_iceberg>1</allow_experimental_insert_into_iceberg>
            <use_iceberg_partition_pruning>1</use_iceberg_partition_pruning>
            <use_iceberg_metadata_files_cache>1</use_iceberg_metadata_files_cache>
        </default>
    </profiles>
    
    <named_collections>
        <minio_s3>
            <url>http://minio:9000/</url>
            <access_key_id>minioadmin</access_key_id>
            <secret_access_key>minioadmin123</secret_access_key>
        </minio_s3>
    </named_collections>
</clickhouse>
```

Now let's create `clickhouse-config/users.xml` - this file defines user access permissions and ensures our applications can connect to ClickHouse properly:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<clickhouse>
    <users>
        <default>
            <password></password>
            <profile>default</profile>
            <quota>default</quota>
            <access_management>1</access_management>
            <networks>
                <ip>::/0</ip>
            </networks>
        </default>
    </users>
</clickhouse>
```

## 🔍 Step 5: Verify MySQL Data and CDC Setup

Perfect! Our infrastructure is running. Now let's verify that our MySQL database is properly set up with data and that our CDC (Change Data Capture) configuration is working correctly. This is crucial because it's the foundation of our real-time data pipeline.

### 5.1 Check MySQL Data

Let's first check that our MySQL database has been properly initialized with our demo data:
SELECT 'Total Users:' as metric, COUNT(*) as count FROM users
UNION ALL SELECT 'Total Products:', COUNT(*) FROM products  
UNION ALL SELECT 'Total Orders:', COUNT(*) FROM orders
UNION ALL SELECT 'Total Sessions:', COUNT(*) FROM user_sessions;"
```

**Expected Output:**
```

### 5.2 Verify CDC Configuration

Excellent! Our data is there. Now let's verify that our CDC configuration is properly set up. This is what enables real-time data capture and streaming:
SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'log_bin';
SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'binlog_format';
SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'gtid_mode';"
```

**Expected Output:**
```

## ⚡ Step 6: Configure ClickHouse Integration

Now we get to the exciting part - setting up ClickHouse! This is where we'll enable the experimental Iceberg features and create the bridge between our operational data and our data lake. ClickHouse will serve as both our analytical engine and the gateway to Apache Iceberg.

### 6.1 Test ClickHouse Connectivity

First, let's make sure ClickHouse is running and accessible. This simple test will confirm our connection:

**Expected Output:**
```
=== CLICKHOUSE INTEGRATION TEST ===
System Info:
25.8.1.5101     2025-08-31 20:47:12
```

**📸 Screenshot Needed**: ClickHouse connectivity test

### 6.2 Create MySQL Engine Tables

Now let's create the bridge between MySQL and ClickHouse. We'll use ClickHouse's MySQL engine to create virtual tables that can read data directly from MySQL in real-time:
-- Create MySQL engine tables for real-time connectivity
CREATE TABLE mysql_users_test (
    id Int32,
    username String,
    email String,
    full_name String,
    age Nullable(Int32),
    country Nullable(String),
    status String,
    created_at DateTime,
    updated_at DateTime
) ENGINE = MySQL('mysql:3306', 'demo_db', 'users', 'olake', 'olake_pass');

-- Test the connection
SELECT 'MySQL Integration Test:' as test, COUNT(*) as user_count FROM mysql_users_test;
"
```

**Expected Output:**
```
MySQL Engine Test:

Sample MySQL Data via ClickHouse:
1       john_doe        john.doe@example.com    premium
2       jane_smith      jane.smith@example.com  premium
3       bob_wilson      bob.wilson@example.com  active
```

**📸 Screenshot Needed**: MySQL engine table creation and test

### 6.3 Create Iceberg Tables

This is where the magic happens! We're going to create Apache Iceberg tables using ClickHouse's experimental Iceberg write support. This is a cutting-edge feature that allows ClickHouse to write directly to Iceberg format, which is perfect for our data lake architecture:
-- Enable experimental Iceberg features
SET allow_experimental_insert_into_iceberg = 1;

-- Create Iceberg table
CREATE TABLE iceberg_blog_demo (
    id Int32,
    username String,
    email String,
    country String,
    order_count Int32,
    total_spent Float64,
    demo_timestamp DateTime DEFAULT now()
) ENGINE = IcebergS3('http://minio:9000/iceberg-warehouse/blog-demo/', 'minioadmin', 'minioadmin123');

-- Insert data from MySQL into Iceberg
INSERT INTO iceberg_blog_demo (id, username, email, country, order_count, total_spent)
SELECT 
    id,
    username,
    email,
    status as country,
    id * 2 as order_count,
    id * 299.99 as total_spent
FROM mysql_users_test 
LIMIT 8;

-- Verify Iceberg data
SELECT 'Iceberg Table Created:' as status, COUNT(*) as records FROM iceberg_blog_demo;
"
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Iceberg Table Test:
8
Sample Iceberg Data:
1       john_doe        premium 299.99
2       jane_smith      premium 599.98
3       bob_wilson      active  899.97
```

**📸 Screenshot Needed**: Iceberg table creation and data insertion

## 🔄 Step 7: Set Up OLake CDC Pipeline

Now we're getting to the real-time data pipeline! OLake is our CDC (Change Data Capture) platform that will monitor MySQL for changes and stream them to our data lake. This is what makes our system truly real-time.

### 7.1 Create OLake Container

Let's set up our OLake environment. We'll create a container and build the OLake MySQL driver from source:
docker run -d \
  --name olake-worker \
  --network clickhouse_lakehouse-net \
  -v $(pwd)/olake-config:/app/config \
  -v $(pwd)/scripts:/app/scripts \
  -w /app \
  python:3.11-slim \
  tail -f /dev/null

# Install OLake dependencies
docker exec olake-worker bash -c "
  apt-get update && apt-get install -y git curl build-essential golang-go
  git clone https://github.com/datazip-inc/olake.git /tmp/olake
  echo 'OLake source code downloaded'
"
```

**📸 Screenshot Needed**: OLake container setup

### 7.2 Build OLake MySQL Driver

Now let's build the OLake MySQL driver. This is the component that will handle the actual CDC connection to MySQL:
  cd /tmp/olake/drivers/mysql
  go build -o olake-mysql main.go
  chmod +x olake-mysql
  ls -la olake-mysql
  echo 'OLake MySQL driver built successfully'
"
```

**Expected Output:**
```
=== OLAKE STATUS ===
OLake Binary Info:
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 58757997 Aug 31 19:58 olake-mysql
OLake MySQL driver built successfully
```

**📸 Screenshot Needed**: OLake driver compilation

### 7.3 Create OLake Configuration Files

Now we need to configure OLake to connect to our MySQL database and our Iceberg destination. We'll create two configuration files - one for the source (MySQL) and one for the destination (Iceberg):
docker exec olake-worker bash -c "
cd /tmp/olake/drivers/mysql
cat > source.json << 'EOF'
{
    \"hosts\": \"mysql\",
    \"username\": \"olake\",
    \"password\": \"olake_pass\",
    \"database\": \"demo_db\",
    \"port\": 3306,
    \"tls_skip_verify\": true,
    \"update_method\": {
      \"intial_wait_time\": 10
    },
    \"max_threads\": 4,
    \"backoff_retry_count\": 3
}
EOF
"

# Create Iceberg destination configuration  
docker exec olake-worker bash -c "
cd /tmp/olake/drivers/mysql
cat > destination.json << 'EOF'
{
    \"type\": \"ICEBERG\",
    \"writer\": {
      \"catalog_type\": \"jdbc\",
      \"jdbc_url\": \"jdbc:postgresql://postgres:5432/olake\",
      \"jdbc_username\": \"olake_user\",
      \"jdbc_password\": \"olake_password\",
      \"iceberg_s3_path\": \"s3a://iceberg-warehouse\",
      \"s3_endpoint\": \"http://minio:9000\",
      \"s3_use_ssl\": false,
      \"s3_path_style\": true,
      \"aws_access_key\": \"minioadmin\",
      \"aws_secret_key\": \"minioadmin123\",
      \"iceberg_db\": \"olake_demo\",
      \"aws_region\": \"us-east-1\"
    }
}
EOF
"
```

**📸 Screenshot Needed**: OLake configuration files

### 7.4 Test OLake Connectivity

Perfect! Now let's test our OLake configuration to make sure it can connect to MySQL properly:
docker exec olake-worker bash -c "
  cd /tmp/olake/drivers/mysql
  ./olake-mysql check --config source.json
"
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Connection Test Output:
2025-08-31T20:47:22Z INFO System has 7GB RAM, setting iceberg writer batch size to 104857600 bytes

2025-08-31T20:47:22Z INFO {"connectionStatus":{"status":"SUCCEEDED"},"type":"CONNECTION_STATUS"}
```

**📸 Screenshot Needed**: OLake MySQL connection test

### 7.5 Discover Tables

Excellent! OLake can connect to MySQL. Now let's see what tables it can discover in our database:
docker exec olake-worker bash -c "
  cd /tmp/olake/drivers/mysql
  ./olake-mysql discover --config source.json > streams.json
  echo 'Tables discovered:'
  grep -o '\"name\":\"[^\"]*\"' streams.json | head -5
"
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Table Discovery Output:
2025-08-31T20:47:22Z INFO System has 7GB RAM, setting iceberg writer batch size to 104857600 bytes
2025-08-31T20:47:22Z INFO Found CDC Configuration
2025-08-31T20:47:22Z WARN binlog_row_metadata is not set to FULL

Tables discovered:
"name":"products"
"name":"users"
"name":"orders"
"name":"user_sessions"
```

**📸 Screenshot Needed**: OLake table discovery

### 7.6 OLake Detailed Schema Discovery

This is really cool! The OLake discovery process generates comprehensive schema information for each table. Let's take a look at what it found:

```bash
# View the complete schema discovery output for the orders table
docker exec olake-worker bash -c "
  cd /tmp/olake/drivers/mysql
  ./olake-mysql discover --config source.json | jq '.catalog.streams[] | select(.name == \"orders\") | .type_schema' 2>/dev/null || echo 'Complete schema discovered'
"
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Large JSON schema output showing detailed field definitions for the orders table including:
- Field types (integer_small, string, number_small, timestamp, etc.)
- Nullable fields with ["type","null"] arrays  
- Primary key definitions
- Supported sync modes (full_refresh, increment)
- OLake metadata fields (_olake_id, _olake_timestamp, _op_type)
```

**📸 Screenshot Needed**: OLake detailed schema discovery output

**Key Schema Information Discovered:**
- **Products Table**: 10 fields including id, product_name, category, price, stock_quantity, with proper type mapping
- **Users Table**: 9 fields including id, username, email, status, country, age with Nullable types
- **Orders Table**: 10 fields with foreign key relationships mapped
- **User Sessions Table**: 8 fields including session tracking data

**OLake Type Mappings:**
- MySQL `INT` → OLake `integer_small` 
- MySQL `VARCHAR` → OLake `string`
- MySQL `DECIMAL` → OLake `number_small`
- MySQL `TIMESTAMP` → OLake `timestamp`
- Nullable fields → OLake `["type","null"]` arrays

**Sync Modes Supported:**
- `full_refresh`: Complete table reload
- `incremental`: Only changed records (when cursor field available)
- `cdc`: Change Data Capture (requires additional setup)

**📸 Screenshot Needed**: OLake table discovery

## 📊 Step 8: Demonstrate Cross-Database Analytics

Now we get to the really exciting part - demonstrating the power of our data lakehouse! We'll show how you can run analytics across both real-time MySQL data and historical Iceberg data, all from a single ClickHouse interface. This is where the magic of our architecture really shines.

### 8.1 Real-time MySQL vs Historical Iceberg Queries

Let's run some queries that demonstrate the power of cross-database analytics:
SELECT 'CROSS-DATABASE ANALYTICS DEMONSTRATION' as title;

-- Real-time data from MySQL
SELECT 'Real-time MySQL Data (Live):' as source;
SELECT 
    status,
    COUNT(*) as user_count,
    groupArray(username) as users
FROM mysql_users_test 
GROUP BY status
ORDER BY user_count DESC;

-- Historical data from Iceberg  
SELECT 'Historical Iceberg Data (Data Lake):' as source;
SELECT 
    country,
    COUNT(*) as user_count,
    ROUND(AVG(total_spent), 2) as avg_spent,
    SUM(order_count) as total_orders
FROM iceberg_blog_demo
GROUP BY country
ORDER BY avg_spent DESC;

-- Data source comparison
SELECT 'DATA SOURCE COMPARISON:' as analysis_type;
SELECT 
    'MySQL (Real-time)' as source,
    COUNT(*) as total_users
FROM mysql_users_test
UNION ALL
SELECT 
    'Iceberg (Data Lake)' as source,
    COUNT(*) as total_users  
FROM iceberg_blog_demo;
"
```

**Expected Output:**
```
=== CROSS-DATABASE ANALYTICS DEMO ===
Real-time MySQL Data:

inactive        1       1499.95 10
premium 3       899.97  18
Data Source Comparison:
Iceberg (Data Lake)     8
MySQL (Real-time)       11
```

**📸 Screenshot Needed**: Cross-database analytics results

## 🌐 Step 9: Access Web Interfaces

Great! Now let's explore the web interfaces that come with our setup. These provide user-friendly ways to interact with our data lakehouse and see what's happening in real-time.

### 9.1 ClickHouse Web Interface

Open your browser and navigate to: `http://localhost:8123`

This is ClickHouse's built-in web interface where you can run SQL queries and see results in a nice format:

Run this query in the web interface:
```sql
SELECT 
    'Modern Data Lakehouse Demo' as title,
    version() as clickhouse_version,
    now() as current_time
```

**📸 Screenshot Needed**: ClickHouse web interface with query results

### 9.2 MinIO Console

Now let's check out the MinIO console, which gives us a visual interface to see our S3-compatible storage and the Iceberg files we've created:

Open your browser and navigate to: `http://localhost:9091`

Login credentials:
- Username: `minioadmin`
- Password: `minioadmin123`

Navigate to the `iceberg-warehouse` bucket to see the Iceberg table files. This is where you can visually explore the data lake structure and see how Iceberg organizes the data files.

**Command to verify MinIO storage:**
```bash
# Check MinIO buckets
docker exec minio-client mc ls myminio/

# View Iceberg files  
docker exec minio-client mc ls myminio/iceberg-warehouse/ --recursive
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Your actual data stored in columnar format
```

**📸 Screenshot Needed**: MinIO console showing Iceberg files

## 🔍 Step 10: Performance Testing and Monitoring

Now let's put our system through its paces! We'll run some performance tests to see how our data lakehouse performs and monitor the system resources to ensure everything is running smoothly.

### 10.1 Performance Comparison

Let's compare the performance of queries against MySQL vs Iceberg to see the difference:
SELECT 'PERFORMANCE COMPARISON: MySQL vs Iceberg' as title;

-- MySQL query performance test
SELECT 'MySQL Engine Query:' as query_type, now() as start_time;
SELECT 'User count by status (MySQL):' as info;
SELECT status, COUNT(*) as user_count 
FROM mysql_users_test 
GROUP BY status 
ORDER BY user_count DESC;

-- Iceberg query performance test  
SELECT 'Iceberg Engine Query:' as query_type, now() as start_time;
SELECT 'User analytics (Iceberg):' as info;
SELECT 
    country,
    COUNT(*) as users,
    ROUND(AVG(total_spent), 2) as avg_spent,
    SUM(order_count) as total_orders
FROM iceberg_blog_demo
GROUP BY country
ORDER BY avg_spent DESC;
"
```

**📸 Screenshot Needed**: Performance comparison results

### 10.2 System Monitoring

Let's also check how our system is performing from a resource perspective:
docker stats --no-stream --format "table {{.Container}}\t{{.CPUPerc}}\t{{.MemUsage}}\t{{.NetIO}}"
```

**📸 Screenshot Needed**: System resource monitoring

## 🚀 Step 11: Advanced Features and Schema Evolution

Now let's explore some advanced features! We'll simulate real-time data changes and see how our system handles them. This demonstrates the power of our CDC pipeline and shows how the system would work in a real production environment.

### 11.1 Add New Data (Simulating CDC)

Let's add some new data to MySQL to simulate real-time changes coming into our system:
docker exec mysql-client mysql -h mysql -u demo_user -pdemo_password demo_db -e "
INSERT INTO users (username, email, full_name, age, country, status) 
VALUES ('olake_test_user', 'olake@test.com', 'OLake Test User', 30, 'TestLand', 'active');

SELECT 'New user added:' as info;
SELECT id, username, email, country FROM users WHERE username = 'olake_test_user';
"
```

**📸 Screenshot Needed**: New data insertion

### 11.2 Real-time Query Update

Perfect! Now let's verify that our ClickHouse MySQL engine can see this new data in real-time:
docker exec clickhouse-client clickhouse-client --host clickhouse --query "
SELECT 'Updated user count from MySQL:' as info, COUNT(*) as total_users FROM mysql_users_test;
"
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Updated user count from MySQL:     12
```

**📸 Screenshot Needed**: Real-time data reflection

## 🔧 Step 12: Troubleshooting and Common Issues

No setup is complete without a good troubleshooting section! Let's go through some common issues you might encounter and how to resolve them. This will save you a lot of time if you run into problems.

### 12.1 Check Service Health

First, let's make sure all our services are running properly:
docker-compose ps
```

### 12.2 Real Issues Encountered and Solutions

During the development of this tutorial, I encountered several real issues. Here are the actual problems I faced and how I solved them:

#### Issue 1: OLake Image Not Found
**Error:**
```
Error response from daemon: pull access denied for datazip/olake, repository does not exist or may require 'docker login'
```

**Solution:** I had to build OLake from source instead. This actually worked out better because we got the latest version:
```bash
docker run -d --name olake-worker python:3.11-slim tail -f /dev/null
docker exec olake-worker bash -c "
  apt-get update && apt-get install -y git golang-go
  git clone https://github.com/datazip-inc/olake.git /tmp/olake
  cd /tmp/olake/drivers/mysql && go build -o olake-mysql main.go
"
```

#### Issue 2: ClickHouse Iceberg Java Writer Missing
**Error:**
```
FATAL failed to test destination: failed to setup iceberg: Iceberg JAR file not found in any of the expected locations
```

**Solution:** This is a known limitation - the Iceberg Java writer component needs to be built separately. This would require help from the OLake team to provide the JAR file.

#### Issue 3: Port Conflicts
**Error:**
```
Bind for 0.0.0.0:3306 failed: port is already allocated
```

**Solution:** I had to update the ports in docker-compose.yml to avoid conflicts with existing services:
```yaml
mysql:
  ports:
    - "3307:3306"  # Changed external port
clickhouse:
  ports:
    - "19000:9000"  # Changed external port
```

#### Issue 4: ClickHouse User Access
**Error:**
```
Code: 194. DB::Exception: default: Authentication failed: password is incorrect
```

**Solution:** I had to create a proper users.xml file to allow access from our applications:
```xml
<clickhouse>
    <users>
        <default>
            <password></password>
            <networks><ip>::/0</ip></networks>
        </default>
    </users>
</clickhouse>
```

### 12.3 View Service Logs

If you're having issues, checking the logs is always a good place to start. Here's how to view logs for each service:
docker logs clickhouse-server

# MySQL logs  
docker logs mysql-server

# MinIO logs
docker logs minio-server

# OLake logs
docker exec olake-worker ls -la /tmp/olake/drivers/mysql/logs/
```

### 12.4 Performance Monitoring

Let's also set up some basic performance monitoring to keep an eye on our system:
docker stats --no-stream

# Check ClickHouse query performance
docker exec clickhouse-client clickhouse-client --host clickhouse --query "
SELECT query_duration_ms, read_rows, query 
FROM system.query_log 
WHERE event_time >= now() - INTERVAL 60 SECOND 
ORDER BY event_time DESC LIMIT 5"
```

## 📝 Step 13: Cleanup and Resource Management

Alright, we've had a great time building this data lakehouse! Now let's talk about how to clean up when you're done experimenting and how to manage your resources properly.

### 13.1 Stop All Services

When you're finished experimenting, you can stop all services with this simple command:

### 13.2 Remove Volumes (Optional)

If you want to completely clean up and start fresh (this will delete all your data):
docker-compose down -v
```

### 13.3 Remove OLake Container

Don't forget to clean up the OLake container we created separately:
